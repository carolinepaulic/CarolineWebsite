    I'm a full stack software developer living in Honolulu, Hawaii. For the time being, I'm working on <a href="https://hnl.io">hnl.io</a>, a social media
    platform for the tech community in Hawaii. My job is awesome and our team is even more awesome, but we weren't able to secure another round of funding,
    so my current position will be wrapping up soon. I'm looking for a new (and hopefully just as awesome) job, so feel free to
    <a href="mailto:carolinepaulic@gmail.com">contact me</a> if you know of anything that I might be interested in.

    My work is incredibly important to me, but I make an effort to set aside time for my hobbies as well.
    I spend a ridiculous portion of my free time whipping up baked goods and decorating cakes. I like to try my hand at all different kinds of arts & crafts projects
    (tables painted to look like sunny side up eggs, jewelry trees made of wire and beads, custom sewn silk curtains with matching pillowcases... you name it). I get super
    excited anytime I get to go outside, which has resulted in me playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_golf" class="subtle">disc golf</a> almost every day and going hiking and
    camping<sup>1</sup> whenever I get an opportunity.
    <span class="note">1 I'm a big fan of s'mores.</span>

    I'm working towards specializing in front end development and I'm interested in venturing into design as well. I have a lot to learn,
    but in the immediate future I'll be focusing on getting familiar with JavaScript frameworks besides Angular. I also want to learn more
    about the magic that can be performed with CSS preprocessors (I'm working with Sass right now and I love it).
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm interested in artificial intelligence and robotics too, but I have very little knowledge and experience in those areas. I'd
    like to dive deeper, but I'm putting robots on the back burner for now in lieu of front end development.
