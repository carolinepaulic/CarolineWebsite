            <h4>Hi there,</h4>
            <h4>I'm Caroline! I'm a front end software developer and baking enthusiast living in Honolulu, Hawaii.</h4>

            <h4>My hobbies include...</h4>
            <p>
                hiking, self improvement, and anything crafty. I have a really big imagination and I thrive on creative activities.
                I'm really into crafting or sewing things for my home (curtains, pillow covers, jewelry trees... the list goes on).
                I love living in Hawaii and going outside! Nature is neat and I spend a good portion of my free time hiking or at the beach.
            </p>

    <h4>I'm working as a...</h4>
    <p>
        software developer at eWorld Enterprise Solutions, a local software consulting company.
        My team is building a web application that manages financial records for the State of Hawaii. The front end is built
        using Google Web Toolkit (GWT) and AngularJS, interfacing via RESTful APIs with the back end, which uses JPA/EJB.
        I prefer working on the front end. Usability is intriguing to me and I pride myself on my ability to make
        things pixel perfect.
    </p>

    <h4>I'm really intrigued by...</h4>
    <p>artificial intelligence, the science of baking, the subtle psychological traits of humans
    that affect how they interact with technology, and people who have imaginations bigger than mine.</p>-->
