    <h3>I'm a full stack software developer working in Honolulu, Hawaii.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I'm currently working as a full stack software developer at eWorld Enterprie Solutions. I'm currently working
        a web application used for financial record management. The front end is built mainly using Google Web Toolkit (GWT),
        but we've started implementing new modules in AngularJS. The back end is built using JPA/EJB, and we use RESTful
        web services to pass data back and forth.</p>
    <p>Although I'm capable of full stack development, my work is mainly focused on the front end. I have a good eye
        for detail and design, and I pride myself on my ability to make a UI pixel-perfect. Recently, my work has mainly
        consisted of creating mockups and lightweight prototypes to demonstrate ideas to our management team and clients, and then
        implementing these ideas using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the AngularJS framework.</p>

                    <b>artificial intelligence</b> and <b>usability research</b>. I love learning about how people tick
                    on a subconscious level and then either trying to mimic that behavior with a computer, or catering a
                    UI to fit that behavior.
