            <p>At work, I'm part of a team that's building a web application used for financial record management.
                Although I'm a full stack developer, my work focuses mainly on the front end. I'm responsible for
                taking business needs and turning them into mockups, then prototypes, and finally implementing them using
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AngularJS. Take a look at my resume for an in depth description of what I do.</p>
