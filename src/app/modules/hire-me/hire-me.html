<div class="subtitle">Why should you hire me?</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    I have over three years of experience in the software industry. I've developed two web apps that are currently in production and I have some QA
    experience under my belt as well.
    <a>Take a look at my resume for more details on my tech skills.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    I have a contagiously positive attitude. I make a conscious effort to be optimistic,
    to give people the benefit of the doubt, to smile, and to be an all-around ray of sunshine.
  </li>
  <li>
    If I do something, I do it right. I take a lot of pride in my work. If I'm not willing to put my all into a task, why take it on in the first place?
  </li>
  <li>
    I'm a sociable person. I can work well on a team and I'm able to clearly articulate my questions, suggestions, and ideas.
  </li>
  <li>
    I'm always willing to answer questions or help my team mates out in any way I can. I strongly believe that mentorship is fulfilling
    for all parties involved, not just the student.
  </li>
  <li>
    I'm also always willing to ask questions. I'm a firm believer in egoless programming, and I will not hesitate to consult my team mates when I need clarification,
    feel that I'm going down the wrong implementation path, or just need to rubber duck. I seek out constructive criticism because it makes for a better product
    when all is said and done.
  </li>
  <li>
    I'm good at science, math, and logic, but I'm also really creative and artistic. Sure, I can code a feature, but I can make it look good too.
  </li>
  <li>
    I don't quit. I will put in the effort needed to track down that annoying bug that mysteriously occurs only some of the time,
    that big new feature request that's intimidating at first, or to clean up all the tedious legacy code that nobody wants to deal with.
  </li>
</ul>

    Caroline Paulic is a fantastic software developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve had the pleasure of working with Caroline as her team lead on several projects over the past two years. Together we’ve delivered web applications and
    solutions ranging from enterprise finance systems to social networks and event platforms. On every project, she’s gone above and beyond with her attention
    to detail, skill, enthusiasm, creativity, and follow-through. She learns quickly from guidance and mentorship, works well both on a team and individually,
    and is always looking for ways to improve herself and others. Her intelligence and drive allow her to deliver excellent results with little-to-no supervision.
    I’ve relied on her time and time again to deliver quality results in a timely manner, and she's never let me down.
  </p>
  <p>
    Caroline has excellent development and technical skills. She can quickly and thoroughly understand the tools, languages, and techniques needed to turn
    complex business rules into working, useful software. I've entrusted the development of entire modules to her, and she's consistently delivered stunning
    results. Some of her recent accomplishments include single-handedly developing a real-time messaging system, and the redesign our flagship product's entire
    user interface, making it more streamlined, user-friendly, and maintainable. Her enthusiasm for user experience drives her to ensure that her products are
    not only technically excellent, but also useful to the user and valuable to the organization.
  </p>
  <p>
    Caroline's ability to work in teams is superb. She has excellent communication skills, and her friendliness, enthusiasm, and motivation are contagious.
    Because of this, she was placed in charge of our organization's community outreach and played a key role in our business development efforts, all in
    addition to her regular engineering responsibilities. We owe a significant portion of our success to her efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Caroline Paulic is a fantastic software developer, and I would hire her again in a heartbeat. She will be a great benefit to any company that shares her
    penchant for quality and value.</p>
